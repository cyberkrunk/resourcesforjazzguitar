description: "A scalar tetrachord is an ordered four-pitch set with scale-like construction. These tetrachords can be thought of as scale fragments, or, conversely, as the buidling blocks for scales. Developing instant recall of them is extremely useful for playing scales across the length of the fingerboard, and also for arbitrarily shifting from one scale to another, mid-stream."

There are a host of skills required for effective improvising on the guitar, let's begin by considering two of them: 1) the ability to play long scale lines, extending from the top of the instrument to the bottom; 2) the ability to arbitrarily change from one scale to another, regardless of where you are in the scale. I have heard Barry Harris emphasize both of these skills, and they have also been key tenets of my studies with Mark Sherman.

Why, then, are both of these skills so challenging on the guitar in particular?

I think that part of the blame lies in the over-emphasis on practicing scales in position. While it is true that scale practice in position leads to good muscle memory and fast execution, it places an obvious limit on range. Position playing also tends to "chunk" a scale into an entire position, making it difficult to change to any arbitrary scale at any point.

In my own practice, I have come to believe that working on scales in four-note groups, or tetrachords, helps to solve both problems. In this article, I will focus on the tetrachords themselves, how they are constructed, and how they are combined to create scales. I will leave the details of how to effectively practice them for other articles and lessons. Conversely, when I reference scalar tetrachords in other materials, I refer anyone who needs a refresher back to this article.

## Constructing scalar tetrachords: intervallic constraints

What makes a tetrachord scale-like? The two key properties of scales is that they are constructed of "smaller" intervals, and they continue in one direction. Let's dive in and start constructing tetrachords by listing some constraints on which "smaller" intervals may be used.

**Constraint 1:** An interval of 1 is allowed, but may not be repeated and must be followed by a different interval; the interval subset (1-1) is not allowed.

**Constraint 2:** An interval of 2 is allowed, and may also be repeated.

With only these two constraints in play, we can generate a group of five tetrachords which combine to form many of the most important scales in jazz: the diatonic modes, melodic minor modes, diminished scale and wholetone scale. For each tetrachord, I will show the ordered interval set used to construct the tetrachord, an ordered pitch set of the tetrachord using integer notation, a representation of the set as points on a number line, and a name for the tetrachord. 

Diminished tetrachord: i(1-2-1) p(0,1,3,4) symmetry: yes

Phrygian tetrachord: i(1-2-2) p(0,1,3,5) symmetry: mirror of major

Minor tetrachord: i(2-1-2) p(0,2,3,5) symmetry: yes

Major tetrachord: i(2-2-1) p(0,2,4,5) symmetry: mirror of phrygian

Lydian tetrachord: i(2-2-2) p(0,2,4,6) symmetry: yes

**Constraint 1a:** An interval of 1 is allowed, and also may now be repeated.

Chromatic tetrachord: i(1-1-1) p(0,1,2,3) symmetry: yes

Ui(1-1-2) p(0,1,2,4)

"Straight, No Chaser" tetrachord: i(2-1-1) p(0,2,3,4) 

Let's now add an entirely new constraint, concerning the interval 3.

**Constraint 3:** An interval of 3 is allowed, but may only be used once in the tetrachord.

Harmonic dominant tetrachord i(1-3-1) p(0,1,4,5) symmetry: yes

i(1-2-3) p(0,1,3,6)

All-interval tetrachord i(1-3-2) p(0,1,4,6)

Lydian minor tetrachord i(2-1-3) p(0,2,3,6)

i(2-3-1) p(0,2,5,6)

i(3-1-2) p(0,3,4,6)

Blues tetrachord i(3-2-1) p(0,3,5,6)

Major pentatonic tetrachord i(2-2-3) p(0,2,4,7) symmetry: mirror of minor pentatonic tetrachord

"I've Got Rhythm" tetrachord i(2-3-2) p(0,2,5,7) symmetry: yes

Minor pentatonic tetrachord i(3-2-2) p(0,3,5,7) symmetry: mirror of major pentatonic tetrachord
