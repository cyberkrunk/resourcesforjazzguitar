description: "The diatonic collection has the deep scale property: each element in its ic vector is unique. By looking at the collection as a 'stack of fourths,' we can easily visualize how and why each ic is unique."

## Interval Class Vectors

Let's begin with some review. A pitch class represents a pitch without regard for octave or enharmonic spelling, so for example, we can write C1, B#2, and Dbb3 all as the single pitch class {0}. We could write out the complete diatonic collection "In C" as follows: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11}.

Similarly, an interval class is the smallest distance, in semitones, between two pitch classes. Let's take the interval between C1 and G1. In pc terms, that would be {0, 7}. So clearly, the distance in semitones is 7-0=7, right? Yes, but there is an even smaller distance if instead of climbing down from 7 to 0, you climb up to 12, which is also 0. So the smallest distance is 12-7=5.
