description: "This article uses some concepts of diatonic set theory to enable a deeper understanding of quartal harmony. The first part looks at how diatonic quartal chords are constructed, the second part includes fingerings and exercises to practice these chords all over the guitar."

It is well understood that quartal harmony is a useful topic area for jazz guitar. However, the way the subject is usually taught does little to shed light on why these chords are, by necessity, structured the way they are.

Pitch class set theory is a branch of music theory that originated in the late 1950s with the composer and theorist Milton Babbit, followed by writers including Donald Martino, Allen Forte, George Perle, David Lewin, Robert Morris, John Rahn, and a host of others. Pc set theory uses concepts and tools from mathematics—including set theory, group theory, and combinatorics—
