        <h2>Guitarist bio</h2>
<p>Like so many other guitarists, I first picked up the instrument as a child and learned to play mostly by ear, learning songs from records and the radio, and playing in garage bands. I began studying in earnest in my teens, studying jazz with local teachers in London Ontario (Franco Cucinelli, <a href="https://tomlockwoodguitar.ca/" target="_blank">Tom Lockwood</a>), playing in a big band (led by <a href="https://lfpress.com/entertainment/local-arts/edmonds-celebrates-what-he-cant-hide-at-london-concert" target="_blank">Joe Edmonds</a>, who was a wonderful man and a top-notch musician), and doing lots of listening. The guitarists I listened to the most included Joe Pass, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Ed Bickert, Grant Green, and Kenny Burrell. I then took up classical guitar (<a href="https://www.raysealey.com/" target="_blank">Ray Sealey</a>, Alan Torok, both of whom were also composers) and at the same time began studying piano, harmony, and counterpoint with an excellent private teacher, David K. Miller, and at the <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/western-ontario-conservatory-of-music-emc" target="_blank">Western Ontario Conservatory of Music</a>. I took a gap year before university and in addition to the theory studies, I practiced for about 8 hours every day.</p>
<p>During my undergraduate studies in theory and composition, I was still required to keep up my major instrument, classical guitar, and pass a performance jury every year--I'm grateful for this, even though I was already ridiculously overloaded with academic work and composing. It was during this time that I also began teaching privately, something that I found very enjoyable and rewarding. All in all, I was a dilligent student, and was awarded with the Western University Gold Medal in Music Theory and Composition.</p>
<p>During grad school, studying composition at the University of Toronto, I was able to focus my time on composing, and of course, complete all the requirements for my doctor of music degree. I didn't have any requirements, or opportunities for that matter, for performing, so my guitarist career went on hold. I was also happy to continue teaching, and taught undergraduate ear training and dictation.</p>
<p>On moving to New York in 1997, I was able to work on some interesting commercial music projects, which included some film and television work, and some pop music engineering. Also at that time, I worked on some demo materials, including guitar and engineering work, with John Legend, who was then still known as John Stephens. In order to earn a living, however, I began working in the technology field, which eventually turned into a 20-year career. With long hours and a very heavy travel schedule, music had to be relegated to a weekend activity. I still kept playing, and also gradually turned my home recording studio (which I had always had in one form or another) into a quite capable setup.</p>
<p>In the early 2010s, I felt compelled to return to jazz guitar. I started occasionally attending the <a href="https://barryharrisinstituteofjazz.org/workshops/" target="_blank">Barry Harris workshop</a>. I joined a combo at the New York Jazz Workshop, and I got a big boost by attending the Jamey Aebersold Summer Jazz Workshop in Louisville. Aebersold really sparked something in me; I recall sitting in a classroom wating for a jazz theory class to start, and with all the students young and old warming up on their horns, I felt moved almost to tears. The guitar facultly was excellent, and I learned a lot from each of them: <a href="https://coreychristiansen.com/" target="_blank">Corey Christiansen</a>, Mike DiLiddo, Craig Wagner, <a href="https://www.zt-music.com/" target="_blank">Zvonimir Tot</a>, Fred Hamilton, and <a href="https://www.davestryker.com/" target="_blank">Dave Stryker</a>. From Stryker, I felt strong connection with what I was after musically, and so I continued to work with his materials through his web teaching.</p>
<p>More recently, since 2021 I have been studying with <a href="https://mileshighrecords.com/mark-sherman/" target="_blank">Mark Sherman</a>, the Juilliard-trained and current Juilliard faculty composer, pianist, vibraphonist, percussionist and band leader. During this time, I've been playing in a very good sextet under Mark's direction.</p>
